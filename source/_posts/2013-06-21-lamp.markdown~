<h3 align="center"> What Is Lamp?</h3>
LAMP is a combination of free, open source software. The acronym LAMP refers to the first letters of Linux (operating system), Apache HTTP Server, MySQL (database software), and PHP, Perl or Python, principal components to build a viable general purpose web server.
The exact combination of software included in a LAMP package may vary, especially with respect to the web scripting software, as Perl or Python are sometimes dropped from the stack.

Like the other LAMP components, <b>Linux</b> is free open-source software which means the source code is available for the operating system, which can be edited according to specific needs.

<b>Apache</b> is an open source web server, the most popular in use.

<b>MySQL</b> is a multithreaded, multi-user, SQL database management system (DBMS) now owned by Oracle Corporation.

<b>PHP</b> is a reflective programming language originally designed for producing dynamic web pages. PHP is used mainly in server-side application software. Perl and Python can be used similarly.
