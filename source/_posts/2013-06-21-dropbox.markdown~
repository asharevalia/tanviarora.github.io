<h2 align="center"> What is Dropbox?</h2>
	"One place for all your stuff, wherever you are."

Dropbox is a home for all your photos, docs, videos, and files. Anything you add to Dropbox will automatically show up on all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website â€” so you can access your stuff from anywhere.

Dropbox also makes it super easy to share with others, whether you're a student or professional, parent or grandparent. Even if you accidentally spill a latte on your laptop, have no fear! Relax knowing that your stuff is safe in Dropbox and will never be lost.

<h2 align="center">Be there for You</h2>

Dropbox works hard to make sure that all your stuff is the same wherever you happen to be. Start a doc from a computer at school or work, make edits from your phone on the way home, then add finishing touches from a tablet in your living room.

With apps available for all your computers, phones, and tablets, you can show off videos, automatically upload photos, or open documents from anywhere.
